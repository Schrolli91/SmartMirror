use debug for any develop information

use info for general infos

warning is for little problems - program can go on

error is a bigger problem
exception is the same as error but writs also the exception message to logfile

critical is not recommended to use - only main program throw an critical at the end in case of an error




how to usw:
===========

logging.debug("Debug Information")
logging.info("Little Info for anyone")
logging.warning("It's a warning")
logging.error("Function abortet")
try:
    try:
        print(1/0) #division by zero
    except:
        logging.exception("Error by an Exception") #log an error with exception test
        raise #throw exception in lower try: clause
except:
    logging.debug("This was throwen by rise in higher try: clause")
logging.critical("Critical Error - Program ended")
